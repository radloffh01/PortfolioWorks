# PortfolioWorks
Files for the personal works on my portfolio

## Below is a desciption of 5 works found on my [portfolio website](https://haydenradloff.wixsite.com/portfolio)

Mystic Refuge is a group project made in Unity. It resembles games made on the PS2 with the grainy pixelated textures and gives off the vibe of an Indie Horror game. You can download the game [here](https://mole-hole.itch.io/mystic-refuge). You can also see who else worked on the project in the credits scene in the game. Unfornuately, the file size was too big to upload to GitHub, so I apologize for not being able to see the code.

[Image Filter](https://github.com/radloffh01/PortfolioWorks/tree/main/Final) is a project written in C++ that takes a user image in .bmp format and can apply a filter to the image
and create a new image of that filter.

[Touch Sensor Lamp](https://github.com/radloffh01/PortfolioWorks/blob/main/project_two.ino) is a project made in Arduino with a Circuit Playground Express, that can change colors and color
modes with a single touch.

[Basic Soccer Simulator](https://github.com/radloffh01/PortfolioWorks/tree/main/Final) is a project made in Visual Studio, written in C#. It's a very simple game that takes user 
input to create teams, and the goal of the game is to score as quickly as possible.

[Let's Play Soccer](https://github.com/radloffh01/PortfolioWorks/blob/main/Let_s%20Play%20Soccer.html) is a text based game that I made with twine on twinery.com. You play as either an attacker or defender and the main objective of the game is to score a goal or don't concede a goal depending on what role you play as.
